"""Hi Tre, this is the code that I have gotten stuck on.
The instructions are to move through 3 levels of if statements and have the machine produce an output.
my issue is that it won't produce the print statements of the (photo_request) and it won't add the $3 to
the (total_bill). My gut tells me that the (photo_request) doesn't need to live under each
if statement... But I'm struggling. So without giving me the answer, how can I think about
this differently? """

# I wonder what happens when I do something
# I will figure out how this works
# When i type here it auto-updates on github desktop... i think
# so i think the process is, commit, then push. Let's try from PyCharm, now.
# So if I was tre, I could type here and Bryce would see the response in PyCharm, once i commit then push
